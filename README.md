## Frequently Asked Questions
### Can I use the plugin with any theme?
Yes. The only prerequisite is that it has the new wp_body_open support that was introduced in WordPress 5.2

### My theme doesn\'t seem to have the wp_body_open support?
Reach out to your theme developer and ask them to update your theme, or alternatively you could use a child theme to add it to the header.php
